<b>A simple python profanity editor</b>
<b>This script makes a clean copy of a file by censoring the profanities</b>

<ul>
	<li>This script censors any profanities in a file by vanishing the 2nd and 3rd letters
        of the profanity.</li>
	<li>Number of letters to be vanished can be adjusted.</li>
	<li>Any combination possible with the capital and small letters of a profanity is blocked.<br> 
        eg- If Puck is a profanity then PUCK, pUCK, etc all are blocked.</li>
	<li>Profanity words can be added in the profanity_list.</li>
	<li>This runs fine on Linux. May need some modifications to run on windows.</li>
</ul>
